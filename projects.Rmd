Seed systems -- the seed savers, breeders, producers, companies, and ag-innovation agencies that are responsible for supplying our agricultural system with seeds -- are complex networks that rely on coordination of information and resources across multiple stakeholders.  Little is known about the systems-level interactions that support such a system, and the organic sector faces particular challenges with regards to research & development, intellectual property protections, and supply chain reliability. Along with the Organic Seed Alliance, I am conducting network analyses of organic seed systems to better understand opportunities for increasing social-ecological resilience. This project is funded by the [Western Sustainable Agriculture Research and Education Program](https://projects.sare.org/sare_project/GW20-216/).

How mandatory information-based policy tools may promote learning by laggard farmers
Nitrogen pollution -- a form of non-point source pollution -- has long been a challenge for environmental policy. Agri-environmental governance schemes that aim to promote best management practices in the United States
have largely been voluntary, resulting in a wide range of conservation behaviors by farmers across the United States. This project focuses on the Irrigated Lands Regulatory Program, a California policy that mandates engagement with information-based tools, particularly educational meetings and plan-writing. In this context we evaluate farmers' response to these tools in order to better understand the complex relationship between environmental governance and promoting conservation behavior among farmers.


#### Science in policy

Transportation and transit governance are highly technical practices. Agencies rely on a vast array of science and engineering inputs to design infrastructure, site and plan operations, and make policies. To understand how and where transportation and transit agencies use science, this project looks at scientific resources that state and regional transit agencies use for plans and projects. Transportation planning and project development processes generate large quantities of procedural documents--plans, project proposals, and environmental assessments, which we analyze to extract and assess the nature and sources of science that informs transportation governance.
