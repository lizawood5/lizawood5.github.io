**Clustering**
Clustering does what?
Euclidian distance cna be measured in any matrix
Distance is a measure of space -- this can be measured as the distance between two vectors in a matrix, as sqrt(sum((x_i - y_i)^2)).
Then with these distances calculated, 
```{r}
?hclust
?dist
```

**Classification**
Classification is a training, but it is still selecting on soemthing
