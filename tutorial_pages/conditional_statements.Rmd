Let's say I want to create some new columns based on a series of conditional statements about my existing data. I have used three main approaches: ifelse(), if else, and case_when(). I'll use a toy example to give some of the pros and cons.

**ifelse()**

```{r}

  Author <- ifelse(is.na(df$Author), 
                      str_extract(df$Journal, "(?<=[Pp]repared\\s[Bb]y\\st?h?e?).*"), 
                      df$Author)
  Publisher <- ifelse(!is.na(df$Author) & is.na(df$Publisher), 
                 str_extract(df$Journal, "(?<=[Pp]repared\\s[Bb]y\\s[a-z+]?).*"), 
                 df$Publisher)
  Journal <- ifelse(!is.na(df$Author) & !is.na(df$Publisher & is.na(df$Journal)
                      str_extract(df$Journal[i], "(?<=[Pp]repared\\s[Bb]y\\s[a-z+]?).*"), 
                      df$Journal[i])
  temp.df <- cbind(Author, Publisher, Journal, i)
  new.df <- rbind(temp.df, new.df)
}
```



**if else, else if, else**

**case_when()**
