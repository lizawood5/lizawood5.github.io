In the beginning of R, life is a series of iterations. We finally write a chunk of code that works, and then we copy and paste it again to tweak a few things... but the more data you have, and the more efficient you want to be, you eventually wish that you could do this just... better. 

From my perpective, utilizing iterations well is the hallmark of an advanced coder. I am not yet in that category, but it can be helpful to spell out what I know so we can learn something about the different approached to iteration.
